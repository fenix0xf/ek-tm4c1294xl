 *  This CRC32 can be specified as:
 *      Width  : 32
 *      Poly   : 0x04C11DB7
 *      Init   : parameter, typically 0xFFFFFFFF
 *      RefIn  : false
 *      RefOut : false
 *      XorOut : 0
 *  This differs from the "standard" CRC-32 algorithm in that the values
 *  are not reflected, and there is no final XOR value.  These differences
 *  make it easy to compose the values of multiple blocks.
